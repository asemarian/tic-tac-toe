## Description

I made this for fun. Wanna play tic-tac-toe against a friend? Start a new game and share the generated game ID with them. Once you start a new game and another player joins, you can play any number of subsequent games as long as both players are still online. This was made possible thanks to the awesome Socket.IO library which makes event-based realtime bi-directional communication a breeze. I decided to use vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM directly instead of a client-side framework for this project.

Technologies and libraries used:

-   JavaScript
